### CALENDAR (v1)

This is a simple calendar app where you can create, edit, and delete events. 

In order to make this work, you'll need to clone the rails backend which can be found [here](https://github.com/keepitrio/calendar-api) and start up the server on port 3001

Then, you can start the server in this repo and voila!
